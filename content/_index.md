Welcome to the UpTech Works, LLC Engineering Playbook.

This is where we document all the things that we standardize within the Engineering Organization here at UpTech Works, LLC. Things like Git Commit Message standards, Branching Strategies, Managing Changelogs, Test Coverage, and many other best practices will be covered here.

It is important to understand that this is a living document and is always open to Pull Requests from employees as we push and evolve these practices together.
