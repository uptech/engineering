At UpTech Works, LLC we organize ourselves in a similar fashion to Spotify with Squads & Guilds. However how we define Squads & Guilds is a bit different. Below is an explainer describing what Squads & Guilds are to us and some examples of how people fit into them.

## Squads

A **squad** is simply a group of people 

## Guilds
