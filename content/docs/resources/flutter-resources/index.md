## iOS Schemes/Android Product Flavors

* "Flutter â€” Separating Build Environment with Multiple Firebase Environment" - Damodar Lohani ([link](https://lohanidamodar.medium.com/flutter-separating-build-environment-with-multiple-firebase-environment-92e40e26d275))
	* Video 1 - Setting up main_dev.dart and main_prod.dart environments ([link)(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgGUtTUatDQ))
		* We more commonly use env.dev and env.prod for environment variables, which differs from this method. However, the next two videos will work with either setup.
	* Video 2 - Setting up Flavors for Android ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZFIMRAWtgw))
	* Video 3 - Setting up Schemes in Xcode for iOS ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdqnxcV7_FY))
		* When setting up Schemes in Xcode, make sure the **Shared** box is checked on each new scheme and that the generated scheme files (ex: dev.xcscheme) are included in the commit to the repo so the next dev can build the project with the correct settings. 

## How do Flavors & DartDefine Flavor work?
Our standard is to use DartDefine & Flavors in our Flutter apps. These allow us to configure our Flutter apps. 
1) In launch.json we have `--flavor` and also a `--dartDefine Flavor=dev`. Are they both needed?
2) Are there any issues with setting the flavor to `local` when working locally?
---
1a: Part `--flavor`: We need both of these in order to properly understand what flavor the app is in. They each are responsible for different things.
* `--flavor` tells Flutter which native iOS/Android command to run when building. When a developer adds flavors to Android or iOS it changes how the commands work. By default without flavors, Flutter will call `assembleRelease` on Android to build the release version, flavors change this command and various others to include the Flavor information. 
* We have `dev` and `production` flavors, so on Android this command is changed to `assembleDevRelease` & `assembleProductionRelease`. Similar things are in motion on iOS.
* The `--flavor` command tells Flutter which command to use. So it is important to not modify this as builds will break, builds may still build/run but the `DartDefines` wont be present and the app will be in a broken state.

1b: Part `--dart-define FLAVOR=dev`:
* This allows the Dart Application to understand what flavor the app is on, since `--flavor` is NOT supported on web so we cant use it and have to use a DartDefine and `--flavor` does not supply the Dart App with any information "to my knowledge".
* Using DartDefines is the recommended way to let the Dart Application to understand what flavor it is, similar to `NODE_ENV=DEV`. 
* The `DartDefine FLAVOR` has the added benefit of letting us use logic flows for when the app is in Dev or Production mode. 
* Two for one!

2: `Flavor Change`: Changing `--flavor` to be `local` would break the builds and is NOT recommended.
* We would have to add additional configurations to iOS/Android for not a lot of gain. 
* We can include a `Local` Launch config which can be used to configure the Dev Debug builds to whatever one needs when working locally.
---
Hopefully this helps explain the details behind `--flavor` and `--dart-define FLAVOR=dev`
