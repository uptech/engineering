The **Roadmapping** phase is where the Tech Lead and the Product representative collaborate together to define a Roadmap of Milestones for the project. During this process we take a number of things into account.

* technical dependencies & constraints
* best way to show client progress without fabricating Demos or doing Demo Driven Development.
* make sure we can internally deliver testable versions to stakeholders

This is done in Jira using the Roadmap feature. The high level Milestones are broken out and defined & prioritized first based on the criteria above in collaboration with Product.

The Product person then takes the User Stories from the [Estimations](/docs/process/estimations/) phase, cleans them up (adding any new ones, adding details to stories, etc.), and organizes them into the roadmapped milestones.
