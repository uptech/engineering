One of the first phases we go through in a project is what we refer to in the engineering space as **Discovery & Definition**.

The goal of this phase is to get a decent understanding of what the project should be and what the initial scope of the project should be.

This is generally done through a series of meetings between the stake holders and Uptech Studio Product, Engineering, and Design representatives. This is where we combine what we know the client wants with our knowledge and expertise to eventually result in what we are actually going to build for them. This is also often where we pose questions or push back on the client to identify if ideas have been vetted and tested to make sure that their money will be well invested.

Once we have these meetings and have come to a conclusion as to what the product should be and what our initial scope will be we move onto the next phase, [Project Planning](/docs/project-planning/).
