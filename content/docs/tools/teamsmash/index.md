Given that [Uptech Studio][] is remote company. We decided it was important to still feel connected & part of a team. So we built a remote connectivity app called TeamSmash, [https://teamsmashapp.com](https://teamsmashapp.com), to address this issue. It is a free app in the macOS App Store so download it, get setup, and feel like part of the team.
