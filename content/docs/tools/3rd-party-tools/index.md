The following is a breakdown of 3rd Party tools that we use and a small bit of information on what we use them for.

## Jira

[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is our project management tool of choice. There are a lot of things we don’t like about Jira. However it is still the leader in our industry and therefore we need to know it well and have as part of our playbook how best to use it. Thus we use it for all of our work here. Also it has features that most of the other solutions don’t have that we think are valuable inspite of the other pain points.

When you are onboarding you should receive an invite to join. If you didn’t contact your manager.

## Confluence

[Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) is our company wiki platform. We use it to document all the things we want to share internally. Like this page for example. Also we use it because it integrates well with Jira which is important from a Product Management standpoint more so than an Engineering standpoint.

You should have access to this once you are invited and accepted and have access to Jira. If there are any issues contact your manager.

## Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a team chat tool that we use strictly for synchronous communication. Like one off random things that need someone’s immediate attention. Think that you are going to break someones focus when you ping them via Slack and you have to be ok with that. Otherwise you should probably be using a better more target asynchronous tools such as GitHub Pull Requests, emails, etc.

When you are onboarding you should receive an invite to join. If you didn’t contact your manager.

## Harvest

At UpTech it is important that we track our time and how we spend it so we can effectively run our business. We use [Harvest](https://getharvest.com/) to help us track our time and how we spend it.

When you are onboarding you should receive an invite to join. If you didn’t contact your manager.

## Tuple

[Tuple](https://tuple.app/) is a remote pair programming tool that we use exactly for that. To share our screens with eachother and pair with eachother at various points in time.

When you are onboarding you should receive an invite to join. If you didn’t contact your manager.

## 1Password

We use [1Password](https://1password.com/) to manage all our passwords both individually and as a team.

When you are onboarding you should receive an invite to join. If you didn’t contact your manager.

## Gumleaf

Gumleaf is a personal task manager centered around the concept of standups. It helps you manage what tasks you are going to focus on today as well as keeps track of which tasks you completed on previous days. It also facilitates generating Slack formatted standups so that you can easily share your standups in Slack channels for all of UpTech as well as standups for specific projects/clients.

This is a spiked side project that Drew De Ponte & Anthony Castelli built and shared the beta build with UpTech to get feedback. That beta release has become daily use tool for most of UpTech. Drop Drew De Ponte an email at `cyphactor@gmail.com` to get the latest beta release.

## Paw

[Paw](https://paw.cloud/) is an HTTP based API development tool for macOS. Similar to Postman which has gain significant popularity. But, we prefere Paw and it’s features and therefore have selected to use it here.

## Google Workspace

We use Google Workspace for Calendar, Drive, Docs, etc. It allows us to manage shared files within the company as well as coordinate using calendars and docs, etc.
