At [Uptech Studio][] we keep a `CHANGELOG.md` following the
[keepachangelog.com][] standard with all libraries and applications we create.

We do this by using the [git-cl][] tool that we built. It enables us to get all
the values of keeping a `CHANGELOG.md` while not having to deal with the
workflow impedances.

To understand more about [git-cl][] you can checkout our [Keep a Changelog
without Conflicts][] blog post which also includes a video introducing the
tool.
