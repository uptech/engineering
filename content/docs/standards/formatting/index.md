There are basically two camps running right now in terms of formatting.

* linting
* automated formatting

In the **linting** camp they use linting tools to tell them that their code formatting doesn't match the standard. While the **automated formatting** camp uses tools that take the code and automatically format it into the standard. This enables developers to write in whatever style they want and it doesn't matter because when they save their code it is automatically formatted into the standard.

We are generally not super religous about what exact formatting rules are used. However, we are **strong** believers in the **automated formatting** camp and run with them on all our projects. Consistency of format is king and we don't want to waste our time in peer review commenting on formatting. Instead we want to spend that time providing valuable real feedback about application architecture and implementation.
