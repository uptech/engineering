Welcome to the Uptech Studio Engineering Playbook.

This is where we document all our standards, processes, references, etc. within the our Software Engineering Organization. Things like Git Commit Message standards, Branching Strategies, Managing Changelogs, Test Coverage, and many other best practices will be covered here.

It is important to understand that this is a living document and is always [open to Pull Requests](https://github.com/uptech/engineering/blob/main/LICENSE) from anyone as we push and evolve these practices together.
