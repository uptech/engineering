We do hold Retrospective meetings **bi-weekly** for the squad to review how things are going. We also collect the following information from the team.

* what went well?
* what didn't go well?
* define action items with owners as a team to improve the process

We also review cycle time and throughput trends to make sure there are no underlying issues that need to be addressed.

This meeting is owned and lead by Product.
