Back in 2013 I did a series of screencasts with a good friend of mine, [Brian Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brimil01). I was going through things trying to remove some of the digital clutter and noise in my life. In the process I found this screencast and realized it is still very applicable today. Therefore, I figured I might as well share it.

In this episode, Brian and I cover the data structure behind git, what commits are really composed of, and how we think people should try and think when using Git. The hope is that this will help get people over one of the larger hurdles in the learning curve of Git.
