Woot woot! The first couple releases of the year are out ðŸŽ‰. These releases include major features as well as important bug fixes.

## iOS

Pullwalla iOS has always helped you **discover** and **examine** pull requests you want to review across all your accounts & repositories.

This release marks the beginning of a new era where Pullwalla begins to achieve it's true vision as **the primary interface for Pull Request Management**, regardless of platform or repository strategy.


One of the big pieces of the **review** and **approve** puzzle that was missing was the new Pull Request Diffs view. With Pullwalla iOS [v1.5.0](https://pullwalla.com/changelog-ios/) and [v1.5.1](https://pullwalla.com/changelog-ios/) you can now access it via the "File Changes" button on the Pull Request Details view. Below is a screenshot in it's beautiful dark mode theme.

This view presents all of the diffs associated with the given pull request and their associated hunks in horizontally scrollable panes. Letting you **review** every last change.

The Pull Request Diffs view also looks great in light mode.

## Bug Fixes

In addition to bringing Pullwalla iOS into a state where it completes the natural chain of **discover**, **examine**, **review**, **discuss**, and **approve**, these releases also include a number of critical bug fixes to further stabilize support for Bitbucket Server in both Pullwalla iOS and macOS.

If you want to see the nitty gritty details, check out the Pullwalla [iOS Changelog](https://pullwalla.com/changelog-ios/) and [macOS Changelog](https://pullwalla.com/changelog/).

### Developer Notes

In this new era we are continuing our work to add support for other platforms (e.g. GitHub Enterprise), extend functionality to facilitate the peer review process, and bridge the gap between Pullwalla iOS & macOS with the use of shared [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) components, like our new Pull Request Diffs view.

### Thoughts or suggestions?

As always, weâ€™d love to hear from you.

Cheers,
The Pullwalla Team
