# Contributing

Thanks for contributing!

The contribution process is simple.

* [open a pull request](https://github.com/uptech/engineering/pulls) with your proposed change and debate and discussion happens around your proposed change until a conclusion is made
* please keep your pull requests [small!](https://engineering.uptechstudio.com/blog/journey-to-small-pull-requests/)

It might be your exact change that makes it in, or it might be a varient of your change that makes it in, or maybe your change gets rejected with an explanation of why. You are always welcome to continue discussions / re-open topics that have been rejected if you discover more information or learnings that help support your position.

In terms of content contribution you should only have to worry about the `content` directory and the folders and files within it.
